# Airbnb London Exploration data analysis(EDA)

SQL [here](https://github.com/kac123451/SQL-Projects/blob/main/AirBNB%20London)

As an entry level junior data analysis I want to present to you my Airbnb London hostings analysis in SQL and Tableau.

**Goal is to find general informations, insights and correlations in London bouroughs and 
use data to guide business strategy**

# Ask

* What can we learn about different hosts and areas?
* What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc)
* Which hosts are the busiest and why?
* Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it?

# Prepare

** Key Insights

* There are 69,319 total properties listed on Airbnb in London, with an average price of £177 per night.
* Entire apartments are the most popular room type, with 41,120 listings and an average price of £227 per night.
* Private rooms are the cheapest option, with an average price of £103 per night, but they are also the least available.
* There are only 403 shared rooms listed on Airbnb in London, with an average price of £97 per night.
* Hotels have the highest average price per night, at £260.

** Conclusions

* Private rooms are the best choice for budget-minded travelers, but there is a demand for more affordable options.
* The most popular areas for Airbnb rentals are in the center of London, such as Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea.
* The boroughs with the highest number of unavailable hosts are also the boroughs with the highest average price per night.
* Hosts who are willing to lower their prices may be able to attract more bookings.
* The data on reviews does not provide much context for the analysis, but it could be useful for understanding the factors that influence guest satisfaction.

Additional Considerations

* The impact of seasonality on the short-term rental market in London. For example, the average price per night is higher in the summer months when demand is higher.
* The impact of government regulations on the short-term rental market in London. For example, the city of London has recently imposed a cap on the number of days that a property can be rented out on a short-term basis.
* The opportunities for Airbnb hosts in London. For example, Airbnb hosts can generate passive income, meet new people from all over the world, and learn about different cultures.
